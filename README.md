# Madlib Coding Challenge

If you don't know what a madlib is, click [here](http://www.redkid.net/madlibs/).

## Objective
Using your knowledge of variables, strings, `prompt()`, and `document.write()`, create your own madlib!

## Requirements
* Use `prompt()` to collect at least 5 pieces of information from the user. Make sure to save their input as variables!
* Use `document.write()` to put their inputs into your own silly madlib!

## Optional
* Use `alert()` to welcome the user to the Madlib before you start asking them questions.
* Use `style.css` to give your page some flare!

## Directions
1. After you have your own copy of the repo, all group members should clone the repo into `/js/classwork/`
2. Roles: everyone is a thinker, but they should be "driving" at different points:  
  a. One partner should drive in their IDE while making `plan.md`. Work together to discuss and write down the madlib in PLAIN english. NO code.  
  b. The other partner should be the driver in their IDE while writing JS in `script.js`. But remember, all group members should be helping! Include the period number at the top of `script.js`  
  c. If there is a 3rd partner, they are responsible for commenting. Otherwise (for groups of 2), the person who drove on `plan.md` should comment `script.js`  
  d. As you are working in the files, make sure you `push`/`pull` your work! Here's what your flow might look like when you reach a good stopping point:  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "update repo"`  
`git push`  
(OR `gp`)  
Partner will then `git pull`

Happy coding!
